## Room 3: Reporting EDA Insights

**Student Task:**
Welcome back from your offline analysis. Summarize your key EDA finding(s) for your Project Manager. Your report must include:

1. The strongest predictor of `price` (optionally also the runner-up).
2. The method you used to reach this conclusion (e.g., correlation matrix, scatter plots, simple linear regression).
3. At least one numeric piece of evidence (e.g., Pearson r or RÂ²) supporting your claim.
4. A brief, plain-language interpretation of the relationship (direction and shape).

If you only name a field without explaining your method and evidence, the door will not unlock.
