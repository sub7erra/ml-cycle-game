## Welcome to Propert-AI!

You are the newest hire in our predictive analytics division. We're excited to have you on board!

Your first project is a critical one. Our real estate agents are struggling to keep up with the fast-moving housing market, and they need a tool to help them provide clients with accurate, data-driven estimates of a house's potential sale price.

**Your Mission:**

Your task is to lead the initial phase of this project. You will need to:
1.  Define a clear project plan.
2.  Identify the necessary data.
3.  Perform an initial analysis.
4.  Suggest ways to enrich the data through feature engineering.

You will be working with a Project Manager, a Data Steward, and a Field Expert to accomplish your goals. This isn't just about math; it's about solving a real business problem for real people.

This is your chance to make a real impact on your first day. Good luck!

### Who you'll interact with

- **Project Manager:** Reviews your plan, challenges your success metric choice, and approves scope.
- **Data Steward:** Before dataset access, only confirms whether specific fields exist. After the dataset is unlocked, can explain the semantics of fields on request.
- **Field Expert:** Evaluates your engineered feature ideas and awards points based on real-world usefulness.
