## Room 1: The Project Briefing

**Student Task:**
Your Project Manager has given you the business goal: "build a model to predict house prices." To get project approval, you must write a formal project plan. Address these three points in your plan:
1.  How will you measure the model's success? Be specific about the metric and why it's appropriate.
2.  What type of Machine Learning problem is this?
3.  What is a non-ML alternative for estimating house prices that we should consider as a baseline?
