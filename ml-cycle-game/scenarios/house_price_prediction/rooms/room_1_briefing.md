## Room 1: The Project Briefing

**Student Task:**
Your Project Manager has given you the business goal: "build a model to predict house prices." To get project approval, you must write a formal project plan. Address these three points in your plan:
1.  What type of Machine Learning problem is this?
2.  How will you measure the model's accuracy? Be specific about the metric and why it's appropriate.
3.  What is a non-ML alternative for estimating house prices that we should consider as a baseline?

**ðŸ’¡ What is a metric?**
A metric is a way to measure how well your model performs. 

For example, imagine you have 100 houses with actual prices and your model predicted prices for all of them. How do you know if your model is good? You must compare the predictions with the actual prices and yield out one single number that you interpret as "quality" of "error". 

There are many metrics for different ML tasks, you can remember (or google) one of them that suites this specific project.
