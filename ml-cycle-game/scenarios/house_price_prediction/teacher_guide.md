# Scenario Teacher's Guide: House Price Prediction

## Lesson Methodology

- **Scenario Goal:** Teach students the process of scoping a regression problem, from business goal to feature engineering, while also practicing communication with different stakeholders.
- **Total Time:** ~2 hours.
- **Prerequisites:** Students should have a basic understanding of Python, Pandas, and data visualization libraries.

### Lesson Flow:
1.  **Introduction (5 mins):** Have students open the main app link and select the "House Price Prediction" scenario. The app will present the initial briefing in Room 0. Your role is to set the stage and ensure everyone is ready.
2.  **Room 1: The Briefing (15-20 mins):** Students articulate their plan to the "Project Manager." Facilitate by helping students interpret the manager's feedback, especially if they get stuck on the concept of relative error metrics.
3.  **Room 2: Data Discovery (15-20 mins):** Students brainstorm features and query the "Data Steward." Encourage them to think broadly before narrowing down. This phase teaches the importance of asking precise questions.
4.  **Offline EDA (30-40 mins):** Students download the dataset and work in their own notebooks. This is the core hands-on part. Roam the room and help with technical issues or prompt them with questions like "What did you find surprising in the data?"
5.  **Room 3 & 4 (20 mins):** Students report EDA findings, then enter the feature engineering phase. The key here is the interaction with the "Field Expert." Emphasize that they need to translate their technical ideas into business value to earn points.
6.  **Room 5 & Wrap-up (10 mins):** Students complete the final task. Conclude with a discussion on the importance of stakeholder communication and how the same data can be viewed differently by a manager versus a field expert.
